## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts – Red Hat Display

### What I learned
- Practiced structuring a component card with BEM-like naming
- Gained experience with CSS variables for consistent theming
- Implemented responsive background images for mobile & desktop
- Explored accessibility techniques (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-label`)

### Continued development
- Experiment with CSS Grid for alternate layouts
- Add JavaScript to handle plan-change interactions
- Convert to a reusable Web Component
